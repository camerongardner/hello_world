# Overview

I am using programming languages that I have not yet learned to develop a firmer foundation in code development practices and learn how to use the different languages.

This software uses the print function in python to print the statement “Hello World” to the user. Additionally, it indicates to the user that I am excited to learn about code.

I have designed this software to provide indication that I am willing to learn about programming languages and develop skills with them.

Here is a how-to video on how the software is meant to be used.

# Development Environment

I used the “Visual Studio Code” source code editor to have a python environment run.

I used Python as the programming language because its simplicity in performing basic tasks that don’t need to be run very efficiently.
